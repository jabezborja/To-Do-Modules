## To-Do-Task for Modules

This web app is created for educational and personal purpose only. I created this for my modules on my school. You can use it too for your school also just follow the installation procedures.

# Installation
You can install this in your own laptop or personal computer for free. I make this repository as Public because I want to share my code that I type here.

Make sure that you already had a Python install and setup a virtual environment.

```
py -m venv env
```

Once you already installed your virtual environment. You can install all Dependencies for the app.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all that done...

You can:
```
py manage.py makemigrations
```
and
```
py manage.py migrate
```
then run the server
```
py manage.py runserver
```

You can find your website on your localhost.
